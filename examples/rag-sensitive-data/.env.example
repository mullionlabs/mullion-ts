# Provider Configuration
# Uncomment ONE of the following to use a real LLM provider:

# OpenAI
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Anthropic
# Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# If no API key is set, the example will run with mock data (no API calls)
