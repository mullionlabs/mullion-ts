# Roadmap

This page is a high-level view. The canonical plan and progress tracking lives in `TODO.md`.

## Near-term focus

- Harden core primitives (DX + correctness)
- Expand ESLint rules and rule documentation
- Improve adapter ergonomics for provider integrations

## Next major milestones

- **Cost estimation** (token estimation, cache write/read economics, provider-aware breakdowns)
- **Trace & observability** (structured trace events, provenance graph, OpenTelemetry exporters)
- More end-to-end examples (Next.js + real-world patterns)

## Canonical source

- `../../TODO.md`
